- If you are uncertain about any specific word or phrase in your translation then you can wrap it in the `\unsure{}` command to highlight it, and add an optional margin note with `\unsure[lorem ipsum]{}`; if there is a whole bit that you want to skip for the moment you can use `\completelyunsure`, which is just `\unsure{[\ldots]}`.
- `\newcommand` definitions go in `includes/commands.tex`.
- Environment definitions are currently in `preamble.tex`.
- Any small (or even big) comments on any corrections or suggestions should be submitted as issues, so that people can see what's been discussed (and when).
- 'notes by the translator' (e.g. about words that don't translate (cf multipodoque')) should be clearly distinguished from original footnotes, maybe just end them with `[trans.]` or put them in the margin?
